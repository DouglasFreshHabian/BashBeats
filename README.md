## Overview ☑️

This project features multiple terminal-based visual styles that simulate music equalizer bars with different color schemes and effects. The user can choose from various visual styles, including **Basic**, **Wave**, **Flashing**, **Gradual Color**, and **Alternating Symbols**.

Each style has a unique effect, with customizable bar heights, symbols, and color schemes. The project is intended to run in a terminal environment and can provide an engaging visual display while performing other terminal tasks.

## Features ⚙️

* Multiple Equalizer Styles: Choose between various dynamic styles (Basic, Wave, Flashing, Gradual Color, and Alternating Symbols).
* Customizable Colors and Symbols: Predefined colors and symbols for each style.
* Easy Menu Interface: An interactive terminal menu allows users to select the equalizer style of their choice.
* Dynamic Frequency Bands: Simulated frequency fluctuations that generate visual bars of varying heights.
* Wave and Flashing Effects: Visual effects such as waves and flashing bars to mimic the behavior of real equalizers.
* Users can also adjust the colors and symbols themselves to further customize and enhance the visual styles..

## Installation 📥

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DouglasFreshHabian/BashBeats
cd BashBeats
```
Set Executable permissions: Ensure that all scripts are executable:
```bash
chmod +x *.sh
```

Run the main script: Start the interactive menu and choose a visual style:
```bash
./equalizer.sh
```
## Usage 🛠️ 

* Upon launching the equalizer.sh, you will be greeted with a banner and an interactive menu.
* Use the arrow keys to navigate or enter the corresponding number to select a style.
* The selected style will start, showing animated frequency bands with different visual effects.
* To exit, select option 6 ("Exit") from the main menu.

## Available Styles 🎨

* `Basic Style`: Displays static bars with simple frequency simulation.
* `Wave Style`: Adds wave-like motion to the bars.
* `Flashing Style`: Alternates between full and empty bars to simulate flashing.
* `Gradual Color Style`: Uses a color gradient based on the height of the bars.
* `Alternating Symbols Style`: Displays bars with alternating symbols and colors.

## Modifying the equalizer's bars 📊
Making Changes to effect length and fluctuation speed:

* By modifying the height variable, you can increase the maximum possible height of the bars.
* You can scale up the random fluctuations that determine the height of the bars.
* You can apply a multiplier to the bar_height to make it more pronounced.

Example: `basic_style` (adjusting height & fluctuation)
```bash
Line 5		height=60   # Maximum height of the bars

Line 17		fluctuation=$((RANDOM % 12 - 6))  # Random fluctuation
```
