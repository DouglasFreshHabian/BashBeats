## Overview ☑️

This project features multiple terminal-based visual styles that simulate music equalizer bars with different color schemes and effects. The user can choose from various visual styles, including **Basic**, **Wave**, **Flashing**, **Gradual Color**, and **Alternating Symbols**.

Each style has a unique effect, with customizable bar heights, symbols, and color schemes. The project is intended to run in a terminal environment and can provide an engaging visual display while performing other terminal tasks.

## Features ⚙️

* Multiple Equalizer Styles: Choose between various dynamic styles (Basic, Wave, Flashing, Gradual Color, and Alternating Symbols).
* Customizable Colors and Symbols: Predefined colors and symbols for each style.
* Easy Menu Interface: An interactive terminal menu allows users to select the equalizer style of their choice.
* Dynamic Frequency Bands: Simulated frequency fluctuations that generate visual bars of varying heights.
* Wave and Flashing Effects: Visual effects such as waves and flashing bars to mimic the behavior of real equalizers.
* Users can also adjust the colors and symbols themselves to further customize and enhance the visual styles..
